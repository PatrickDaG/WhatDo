# WhatDo
App to help me decide which game to play.

If you find yourself indecisive which of your 1000 steam games
to play this is the app for you. Just start and make the gods of rng choose for you.

This app currently supports syncing games from steam and adding your own custom games.
Just execute
```bash
./whatdo
```
and the rest should be self explanatory.
